I have over 7 years of IT experience. 5 year developing web based solutions. Good knowledge of Java and Java technologies. Most
projects were implemented with Spring IoC, Spring MVC, Hibernate. I am huge fan of Grails framework, which became my
preferable platform for new projects. I am adept of testing and love Selenium. My experience and knowledge allows to use it
effectively and adopt to project needs. So its configuration and utilities matches project needs.

My experience covers almost all project phases: Management, development, testing. Over this time Iâ€™ve got experience with:
* Project management using agile methodologies. Average team 5 members, maximum team size 9 members
* Web based projects and server projects. I have experience with served side framework and persistence layer frameworks. Also front
end frameworks like Angular Js
* Desktop application development, using swing

I am Co-founder of local it conference [http://itevent.if.ua](http://itevent.if.ua) and local user group [http://itbooze.com.ua](http://itbooze.com.ua)

Few days ago I've received awesome present from [DZone.com](http://dzone.com/) team for contribution. Not sure if there are anything that can motivates more to contribute and write. Presents are really nice but I would say the most valuable for me was such interest and acknowledgment. From the letter it is seen that currently there are 650K members and audience over 3 millions visitors. I am reading DZone for years and always was exited about quality of content, but now I am exited to be part of contributors team. With all my respect I want to say thank you to DZone team for creating, maintaining and making better such great resource.
